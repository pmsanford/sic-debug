SIC Debug
=========

This is an interpreter and basic debugger for the Simple Instructional Machine as laid out in Leland L. Beck's book. The initial commit is how I left it when I wrote it in my junior year of college. I will be making periodic improvements and cleaning up the code.

It is designed to run both Simple SIC and SIC/XE programs in the standard format and the extended relocatable format. I will be first ironing out bugs in the current functionality and then refactoring it for usability and reliability.
